# KamiCommonNMS
- The NMS (net.minecraft.server) portion of the KamiCommon library.
- On August 31, 2024, this library was removed from KamiCommon into its own repository.
- It aims to support versions: 1.8.X to LATEST

## Disclaimers
- 1.17+ only officially supports **Paper** as the server software.
- This library requires **Java 21** to be used, as such any version of server jar must be runnable on Java 21 as well.
  - It is highly likely older versions need to be specially compiled for Java 21.
